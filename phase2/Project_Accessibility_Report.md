1. **For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:**

    **Principle 1: Equitable Use:**


    Our application does not stigmatize or segregate any users. All users will be able to access all of the functionality features of the application.


    **Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**


    Users can freely choose the type of playlist order on a functionality level between repeat, shuffle, or by order as a music player. On an administrative level, users can change their passwords as they wish.


    **Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**


    Our application has a very intuitive approach from the beginning. Users are prompted to register upon launching the app and, afterwards, will be automatically put to the login page. Then, they will see icons that are responsible for their respective function.


    **Principle 4: Perceptible Information**


    Our chosen colour scheme is very balanced and thus making the application easy to view and use in both day and night scenarios. Through our minimalistic design, our layout communicates with the user with practical and easy-to-understand icons.


    **Principle 5: Tolerance of Error**


    The principle does not apply to our application as there are close to no potential hazardous and adverse consequences when using the application.


    **Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**


    The user doesn’t need to worry about manually playing the next music with the three playlist modes. Thus, our design can reduce the number of repetitive actions the user needs to do.


    **Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**


    As a mobile application, the user can easily interact with the elements on the screen regardless of how the device is held.


2. **Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

    Since we used Android Studio to design our program, our primary audience would be people with Android devices.  Including people who use android emulators on computers. Amongst these people, we target those who listen to music very often and have many locally downloaded music on their devices. Our program will help locate and manage these music files for a better listening experience.


3. **Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that a braille printer can print are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.**

    Similarly to the above, since we developed a program for Android devices, it is unlikely that an Apple device user will use our program since it will not be compatible with the system. On the other side, people who do not listen to music or don’t regularly listen to music will be less likely to use our program. They are probably less interested in having a dedicated program to enhance the experience of something they do not do regularly.
